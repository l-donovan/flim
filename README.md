## What is it?
`flim` is a markup language that seeks to combine the versatility of YAML with the simplicity and straightforward syntax of JSON. The language is made especially powerful through the use of transformers,
single-input-single-output functions whose functionality is provided entirely by the user during evaluation, an optional step after parsing. In this way, logic is completely separated from markup.
You are in full control of which, if any, transformers can be used in the `flim` files you're evaluating.
